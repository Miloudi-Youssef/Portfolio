## Available Commands

Inside the project folder, you can use the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Launches the app in development mode.  
Access it at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The page will automatically reload when you edit any files.  
Lint errors and build warnings will show in the console.

### `npm test`

Starts the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See more details here: [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)

### `npm run build`

Builds a production-ready version of the app into the `build/` folder.  
Includes optimizations like code minification and hashed filenames.

For deployment guidance, refer to the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Use with caution.**  
Once you eject, you can’t go back! This gives you full control over config files (Webpack, Babel, etc.), but you’ll manage everything manually.

Most projects do **not** need to eject, but the option is there if full customization is needed.
